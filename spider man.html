                  <h3>SPIDER MAN</h3>
                   <p>The fictional character Spider-Man, a comic book superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and featured in Marvel Comics publications, has appeared as a main character in numerous theatrical and made-for-television films.</p>

<p>Nicholas Hammond first starred as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the 1977 made-for-television film Spider-Man and would appear as the character two other times. In 1978, the Toei Company created a theatrical spin-off of their Spider-Man television series, with Shinji Todō reprising his role as Takuya Yamashiro / Spider-Man. By 1999, Sony Pictures Entertainment had acquired the film rights to the character, creating two film series until 2014: the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy of films (2002–2007) starring Tobey Maguire, and the Marc Webb Amazing Spider-Man films (2012–2014) starring Andrew Garfield.</p>

                   <p>In February 2015, Disney, Marvel Studios, and Sony made a deal to share the Spider-Man film rights, leading to a new iteration of Spider-Man being introduced and integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The deal allowed Sony Pictures to continue to own, finance, distribute, and have final creative control of the solo Spider-Man films, with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributing the films with his other appearances in a supporting capacity. Tom Holland portrays this version of Spider-Man, and has appeared in six films to date, from Captain America: Civil War (2016) to Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). In September 2019, following a brief stand-off resulting in the termination of the old agreement, Disney and Sony relented to fan outcry and reached a new agreement for Holland's version to make at least two more appearances: in another solo film, Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) where he appears alongside Maguire and Garfield who reprise their roles in the film, and another team-up film. In December 2021, Feige confirmed that he and Pascal, along with Sony and Disney are already developing a fourth MCU Spider Man film.</p>

                   <p>Plans for an animated Spider-Man film were announced by Sony in April 2015, which eventually became Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) from Sony Pictures Animation. Shameik Moore voices Miles Morales / Spider-Man in the film, along with various other versions of Peter Parker and alternate versions of Spider-Man from the multiverse also appearing. Sequels and potential spin-offs are planned.</p>

<p>The Spider-Man films have been generally well-received. They have collectively grossed over $6.3 billion at the global box office, with Far From Home becoming the first Spider-Man film to gross over $1 billion worldwide followed by No Way Home that became Sony's highest-grossing film ever. Additionally, Into the Spider-Verse won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.</p>
