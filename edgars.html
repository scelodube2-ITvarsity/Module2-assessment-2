                  <h3>EDGARS</h3>
                <p>Edgars was founded as a small retail shop on Johannesburg's Joubert Street in 1929-just as the world's economy slumped into the Depression era. The Edgars store held on, however, and in 1935 began its long climb to the top of South Africa's retail market. In that year the store moved its premises to Cape Town.</p>
                   
                <p>As part of Edcon, Edgars was included in an ill-fated buyout by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital Private Equity LP in 2007, which burdened the parent company with debt just as the economy hit a downturn following the global financial crisis. In June 2020 Edcon put the chain up for sale, 7 July 2020 it was announced that Edcon has signed an agreement to sell the chain to Durban-based Retailability, which operates 460 stores across Southern Africa and is the owner of brands Legit, Beaver Canoe, and Style. Edcon had sold Legit to Retailability four years prior.</p>

<p>In 2014 Edgars opened at a new 50,000 square meter shopping centre in Nairobi, Kenya. In 2018 Edgars introduced a new, larger 8,000 square meter store in Fourways Mall in Johannesburg, featuring trees, play areas, a coffee shop, “beauty rooms” where customers can get makeovers, and a section that allows customers to print their own text or images on clothing. Edgars promoted the new prototype store design as "a bit like a town square, a multi-sensory, tree-lined central social space". In January 2020 it announced it would close its 6,000 square meter store in the upscale Rosebank Mall in Johannesburg suburb Rosebank.</p>
