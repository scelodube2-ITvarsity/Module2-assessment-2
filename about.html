                   <p>The Pavilion is the second largest shopping centre located in Westville near Durban and one of the largest in South Africa. The mall has gone through many phases of extensions.The mall was developed in the early 90s and opened in October 1993 by Murray and Roberts, (now Concor), to initially provide 75,000 m2 (810,000 sq ft) of shopping space. Subsequently, the centre has gone through six phases of expansion, the most recent of which was completed in 2014, bringing the floor space to just under 135,000 m2 (1,450,000 sq ft). An additional 35,000 m2 (380,000 sq ft) expansion is planned for 2018. We take pride in creating amazing shopping for everyone.</p>
